    <h1> More SQL </h1>
    <h2> SQL Inner Join </h2>
    <p> Structured Query Language, or SQL is a tool that allows you to access
      and control multiple databases of information simultaneously. When
      working with several databases, one might want to combine columns
      from different columns to either present a entirely new table or simply
      add to an existing one. This is where the Join operation comes in. A join
      clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related
      column between them.There are four different types of Join clauses, each
      with an unique matching method. The clauses include: Inner, Left, Right,
      and Full join. Inner Join, which I will be focusing on, returns items that
      are present in both tables. Meaning that, when you call an inner join clause
      on two tables, a new result table will be created with records that have
      matching values in both tables.To get even simpler, records from table 1 and table 2 will only
      be selected if they meet the join condition. Unlike the other join types,
      inner join does not take all records from one or both tables regardless of
      the records meeting the join criteria or not. This is why inner join is
      considered to create an entirely new table while the other joins just extend
      the current tables. Example is shown below:
